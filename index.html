                    <h4>Do i really need all my ingredients to be at room temperature?</h4>
                    <p>Yess! I cannot stress this fact enough! So many people think this is insignificant, but the
                        temperature of your ingredients majorly affects the finished product. Your ingredients must
                        always be at room temperature, unless mentioned otherwise in the recipe. Lay out all your
                        ingredients on the kitchen counter at least 30 minutes before you start. A recipe that calls for
                        creaming butter and sugar will not work if your butter is cold. It needs to be soft to be able
                        to get to the right consistency and trap air. Having ingredients at room temperature allows them
                        to combine with each other homogeneously. Cold ingredients will not combine smoothly, leading to
                        denser cakes, hard and flat cookies and clumpy frosting!</p>

                        recipes, it is not so simple the other way around. The germ and bran in whole wheat absorb more
                        water, making baked goods denser and more crumbly. In cakes, where you need that light, fluffy
                        and airy texture, you must stick to using all purpose flour. </p>

                    <h4>I don' t have a stand mixer, can i still make this?</h4>
                    <p>While a stand mixer definitely makes the job so much easier, you compulsorily do not need to
                        invest in one to create delicious, stunning desserts. A stand mixer is quick and efficient, but
                        a balloon whisk or a wooden spoon too can do a pretty good job. You'll have to strain your
                        muscles quite a bit to achieve the desired results though, haha! I suggest investing in a simple
                        electric hand mixer, if not a stand mixer. It is extremely useful and versatile and would make
                        baking seem almost effortless!</p>

                    <p>Generally speaking, no. Butter cannot always be replaced with oil in baking recipes. Oil lacks
                        butter's essential quality to be whipped. Butter is also essential in contributing to the flaky
                        texture of pie and tart dough. You also can not replace butter with oil in cookie recipes. That
                        will ruin the cookie dough texture and your cookies will spread too much. They will also not
                        firm up because oil doesn't set like butter does.</p>

                    <p>There's a few reasons why your cake might crack on the surface. Usually, it is because the
                        temperature of the oven is too high. When the oven is too hot, the outside of the cake cooks
                        much faster than the inside. Soon, a crust forms while the inside of the cake continues to bake
                        and rise, forming a crack on the crust.</p>

                    <p>Yes, the cake is definitely under baked. Even if a cake has a perfect golden brown edge and nice
                        looking crust, but still sinks in the middle, you didn't bake it for long enough. The cake
                        should have a springy texture, not a gooey one. If you are unsure of whether the cake is baked
                        through, try doing the touch tests.</p>

                    <h4>Can I substitute whole wheat for all-purpose flour?</h4>
                    <p>Replacing white flour with whole wheat generally makes baked goods denser, drier, and more
                        crumbly because the germ and bran in whole wheat absorbs more water. So in the case of baked
                        good where you want a light and tender texture, like cake, it's just a bad idea. In the case of
                        pancakes, muffins, and quick breads, though, where the batter tends to have more liquid, you can
                        usually get away with substituting up to 25% of the white flour for whole wheat. It will
                        definitely have an impact on the texture, but usually in a way that is intriguing rather than
                        disastrous, and will add some flavor and nuttiness to the equation.</p>

                    <h4>Do I really need parchment paper?</h4>
                    <p>Parchment paper is an essential baking tool because it creates a nonstick surface. If you want
                        cakes to release cleanly, brownies to lift out of the pan, and cookies to slide off the sheet,
                        parchment paper is a must. It can be a little pricey, but it's also available in pretty much
                        every baking aisle and is 100% worth it—way better than having a cake that you worked so hard on
                        refuse to come out of the pan.</p>
